I'm hiring a pet sitting professional working in Chicago, Illinois. I'm hoping to hire a knowledgeable, reliable person who has availability for October 15-25th of 2018. I will be out of town Iâ€™m Europe, but available by phone and email. It is very important that one of my two cats takes his medicine 3x daily (every 8 hours)\r\n\r\nService Requirements:\r\nOur family is in need of cat feeding, litter box cleaning and administering medication (for one of my two cats). I need you to be able to travel to my home and take care of them from here 3x a day for the duration of my trip. The ideal pet care provider would have some Vet Tech experienced in administering pills and liquid medications to cats prior. Also I need you to look out for his symtoms of labored breathing, which he will need to be taken to the vet for or for you to notify the other help I will have here for that. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT. His lungs fill with fluid so noticing that is saving his life, anything a little offor heavy or distressed in his breathing and straight to the vet, either South Loop Animal Hospital or MedVet seeing as they have been informed and have his records. \r\n\r\nI am setting up to either have two trained people (one for each medication time) or one overnight stay at my place for the duration of my tip. I also have a friend her and she will be watching over him a lot but she is not medically trained, just an animal lover. This is a lot but totally manageable and I need help soon, please contact me for more information if you think you can help manage my baby. He is sweet and super easy to handle with pilling and caring for too - not a fusser!\r\n\r\nNotes On Availability:\r\nWe can likely work around your schedule, but around 8hrs  (preferably 12hrs) between each visit is Required for my little guys medicine.\r\n\r\nGetting In Touch:\r\nYou can reach out via this website and expect a response ASAP\r\n\r\nhopetaylormedia at gmail dot com is my email and \r\n\r\nMy number is 312-841-...\r\n\r\nThank you\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ch4\u003eRelevant Experience\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Cats\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch4\u003eServices\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Pet Sitting\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u003c/ul\u003e","employmentType":"Contractor, Part-time","hiringOrganization":{"@type":"Organization","name":"PetSitter.com","sameAs":"https://petsitter.com/","logo":"https://k8s-prod-cdn.careguide.com/assets/avatars/petsitter-listing-160x160.png"},"identifier":"employing-chicago-vet-tech-cat-sitter-pet-job-il","image":"https://k8s-prod-cdn.careguide.com/assets/avatars/petsitter-listing-160x160.png","jobLocation":{"@type":"Place","address":{"@type":"PostalAddress","streetAddress":"Chicago, IL","addressLocality":"Chicago","addressRegion":"IL","addressCountry":"USA","postalCode":"60608"}},"qualifications":null,"responsibilities":"Pet Sitting","title":"Dog Sitter","url":"https://petsitter.com/employing-chicago-vet-tech-cat-sitter-pet-job-il","industry":"Pet Sitting","baseSalary":{"@type":"MonetaryAmount","currency":"USD","value":{"@type":"QuantitativeValue","value":15.0,"unitText":"HOUR"}}}
