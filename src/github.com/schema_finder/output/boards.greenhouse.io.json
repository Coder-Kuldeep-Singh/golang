Its critically acclaimed sleep surface was developed in-house, has a sleek design, and is delivered in a small, \"how did they do that?\"-sized box. The company is one of the fastest-growing consumer brands of all time, and its product line has expanded to include sheets, pillows, a matching foundation, and a dog mattress. Casper was named one of Fast Company's 50 Most Innovative Companies in 2017, and its eponymous mattress was crowned one of TIME Magazine's Best Inventions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are deeply committed to building a diverse and inclusive workforce so that we represent all those who dream big equally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen you’re not catching zzz’s, this is what you’ll do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProvide exceptional service to every person that walks through our doors\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFollow up with customers through clienteling and e-mail correspondence\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHelp Casper maintain a healthy sales pipeline by collecting guest contact information and inviting individuals to trial our products\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMaintain the highest level of product knowledge and expertise\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMaintain the visual integrity of the space\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCreate and process in-store sales\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eProcess and receive inventory replenishments\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAssist with setting up and executing community programs and events\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRecord and relay recurring customer feedback and insights to internal teams such as tech, marketing, design, and product in order to constantly improve the customer experience\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur dream candidate is...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExcellent communicator with a passion for people\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStrong written and oral communication skills\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEffective and expedient problem-solver with a meticulous attention to detail\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePassion for Casper's core mission and values\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePositive attitude and feels there is no task too small\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSelf-starter; entrepreneurial disposition\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEager to be at the frontline of a fast-paced and growing brand\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMust understand and appreciate experiential retail\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAbility to lift 50 lbs. and be on your feet all day\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMac and Google suite proficiency is a plus\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe hope you enjoy this experience.
